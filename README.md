# SimpleTodoApp

## Project Info
Yet another simple React-Redux Todo App

## What is this?
Well, this will be just another simple todo app using React and Redux.
I guess I will be having fun (:

## Modules

I will be using the following modules:
* React
* React router
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel

## How to run?

Be sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed.
In the root directory (where package.json resides), run `npm install` in order to resolve and download project dependencies.

Then you can run it in development mode: `npm run dev` and browse to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)

You can also compile the project running `npm run compile`. It will compile the project into `dist/` directory as an `app.js` file. Open `dist/index.html` to browse the result.

## Something else?

Feel free to cherry-pick whatever you like about this project.
I will continue updating this project frequently as soon as I keep learning new things about these technologies.

## "That's all Folks!"

Have a good, non-bugged, day,

Jes√∫s
